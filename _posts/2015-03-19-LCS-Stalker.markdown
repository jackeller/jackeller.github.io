This project is a spare-time project to flex my muscles working in angular.  This is currently being worked on, and I expect to finish around the end of April.

The purpose of the project is to collect information about professional players in the LCS, which is a pro gamer league for the game League of Legends.  I am building it to work with the <a href="http://dev.twitch.tv/">Twitch API</a> and the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/">League of Legends (Riot Games) API</a>.
